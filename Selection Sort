Selection Sort actually uses the concept which you used to use for Bubble sort.
i.e. Compare the first element with the next elements and swap it with element which is smallest in the array.
By doing this the smallest element comes to the first place. Now take j=1+i element and compare with other elements.
So in this way the smallest elements will keep on coming forward and the array will be sorted.

Time Complexity = O(n^2)

Code :
#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

int main()
{
	int i,j,min_index,min_val,k;
	int arr[] = {22,56,11,82,28,9,90,55};
	
	for(i=0;i<8-1;i++)
	{
		min_val = arr[i];
		for(j=1+i;j<8;j++)
		{
			  if(min_val>arr[j])
			  {
				
			  	min_val  = arr[j];
				  min_index = j;
			  }
		}
		   	    arr[i] = arr[min_index]^arr[i];
		   	    arr[min_index] = arr[i]^arr[min_index];
		   	    arr[i] = arr[i]^arr[min_index];
	}
	
	for(k=0;k<8;k++)
	{
		printf("%d ",arr[k]);
	}
	return 0;
}
