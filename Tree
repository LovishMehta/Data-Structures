A tree is a hierachial data strucuture

=>In Arrays,Stack's,Queue's elements are sequentially connected to each other that's why called "Linear" data strucuture
=>Trees are "Non Linear" data strucutre as its elements are not sequentially connected to each other.

A tree is defined as finite set of one or more data items(nodes) such that (nodes are linked lists)
1. There is a special node called the root of the tree.(rsabse upar vala node is called root node).
2. The remaining nodes are partitioned int n>=0 disjoint subsets, each of which is itself a tree 
   and they are called subtrees.

************************
Common terms in Trees
************************
DEGREE: The number of sub-trees of a node are called its degree. (jitne subtrees honge utni degree hogi)

LEAF: A node with the degree zero is called leaf.

Terminal Nodes: The leaf nodes are also called leaf nodes.

DEGREE OF TREE: The degree of tree is maximum degree of the nodes in the tree.

ANCESTORS(purvaj): The anscestors of a tree are all the nodes along the path from the roots to that node. (kisi particular node k upar
           jitni bhi nodes hai unhe ancestors kehte hai)
           
DESCENDANTS(vanshash): The descendants of a node are all the nodes along the path from the node to the teminal node.( kisi node se neeche
                       jitne bhi node hai terminal node tak unhe descendants kehte hai).
                                            
LEVEL NUMBER: Each node is assigned a level number. The root node of the tree is assigned a level number '0'.
              Every other node assign a level number which one is 1 more than the level number of its parent.
              
GENERATION: Nodes with same level number are said to belong to same generation.

EDGE: A line drawn from a node N of T to a sucessor is called edge.

PATH: Sequence of consecutive edges is called path.( path ek node se kisi bhi node tak ho sakta hai (edge bole to line))
     (path can be from node N1 to N5)
Branch: PAth ending in a leaf(or Terminal Node) is called a branch. (vo path jo terminal node p jake khatam ho use brach kete hai)

HEIGHT/DEPTH: The height or depth of a tree is the maximum number of nodes in a branch.

Binary Tree
*************************************************************************************************************************************
A binary tree T is defined as a finite set of elements,called nodes such that
1. T is empty(called the null tree or empty tree),or
2. T contains distinguished nodes R,called the root of T,and the remaining nodes of T form an ordered pair of disjoint 
   binary trees T1 and T2.
   (kehne ka matlab ya to tree empty ho aur agar uske subtrees ho bhi to maximum 2 subtrees hi ho usse zyada na ho further 
    subtrees bhi yhi rule follow kare. 2 subtrees se kam ho sakte hai par usse zyada ni)
    
*Complete Binary Tree: It is defined as a binary tree whose non leaf nodes have non empty left and right sub tree and all leaves 
                       are at same level.
                       (It means as we know binary tree k maximum 2 hi nodes(child) ho sakte hai to complete binary tree vhi hai
                       jiski har node har level p filled ho. Koi bhi khali ni honi chahiye)
                       (defination in hindi, aisa tree jiski non leaf nodes (non leaf nodes matlab jinki degree 0 se zyada ho k
                        jo right left subtrees hai vo non empty ho aur saare leaves same level p ho.)
                        (leaves matlab vo nodes jinki degree 0 ho, degree 0 bole to having no furhter subtrees)
                        
* Almost Complete Binary Tree: Almost complete binary tree is defined as a binary tree whose non leaf nodes have non empty left and 
                               right sub-tree and all leaves are either on at the last level or second last level.
                               (itna hi difference hai ki sare leaves ek hi level p na hokar agar second lasr or last level par ho)
                               
* Strict Binary Tree: A binary tree is called a strict binary tree if every non leaf node in the binary tree has non empty left and
                      right subtree.
                      It means each node will have either 0 or 2 children.
                      (aisa koi non leaf node ni hona chahiye jiske e child ho ya to 0 child ho ya 2 child ho)
                      
* Extended Binary tree: An extended binary tree is a tree that has been transformed into a full binary tree.This transformation is
                        achieved by inserting special "external" nodes such that every "internal" node has exactly two children.
                        
 ****************************************
 Pre-Order Traversal of binary Tree
 ****************************************
 1. We firstly process the root R of tree.
 2. Then traverse left subtree of R. 
 3. Then traverse right subtree of R.
 
***************************************************************************************** 
Code: using Recurssion (Not yet checked the binary tree representation from Geeksforgeeks)
******************************************************************************************
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct node
{
	int info;
	struct node *left;
	struct node *right;
};

struct node* create_node()
{
	struct node *ptr;
	ptr = (struct node*)malloc(sizeof(struct node));
	return ptr;
}

void preorder_traversal(struct node *root)            // preorder function using recursion
{                                                     // 10 20 40 50 30 60 70
	if(root)

*****************************************************************************************************************
In-order Traversal of binary Tree
****************************************************************************************************************
1. Firstly Traverse the left subtree of R in inorder.
2. Process the root R.
3. Traverse the right subtree of R in inorder.

****************
code: Recursive
****************
The code is same as above just change the postorder_traversal function with inorder_traversal

void inorder_traversal(struct node *root)
{
	if(root)
	{
		inorder_traversal(root->left);  // 40 20 50 10 60 30 70 
		printf("value :%d\n",root->info);
		inorder_traversal(root->right);
	}
}

OUTPUT: 40 20 50 10 60 30 70

**********************************************************************************************************************
Post-order Traversal Tree
**********************************************************************************************************************
1. Firstly we traverse the left subtree of R in postorder
2. Then we traverse the right subtree of R in postorder
3. process the root R.

**************************
Code using Recursion
*************************
Same as above just replace the function preorder with postorder

void postorder_traversal(struct node *root)
{
	if(root)
	{
		postorder_traversal(root->left);  // 40 50 20 60 70 30 10 
		postorder_traversal(root->right);
      printf("value :%d\n",root->info);
	}
}

OUTPUT: 40 50 20 60 70 30 10
